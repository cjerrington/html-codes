Ever wonder how to get the special characters like 	&szlig;, 	&ccedil;, &dagger;, &para;, &divide;, &Psi;, &Omega;, &#9986;? 

Using this app you can search for the charater by description or the Entity, Decimal, or Hex codes. 

If you find an error or would like to add a character add a pull request and give the proper codes for all sections if available. The codes are located in the symbols.json file.
